JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with various databases, including MySQL. JDBC provides a standard interface for connecting Java applications to relational databases, executing SQL queries, and manipulating data. It acts as a bridge between Java programming language and databases like MySQL, enabling developers to write database applications in Java that are portable across different database systems. In essence, JDBC facilitates seamless communication and interaction between Java applications and MySQL databases, enabling tasks such as querying, updating, and managing relational data.
The whole application was developed using Java with database driver connection and data queries were run using mysql
